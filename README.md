# BAD Login UI 🔥

An exaggerated (and slightly evil) example of how not to design a user experience.

---

## About the Project

This project simulates one of the worst possible user experiences when filling out a login form:

- Every time the user tries to type a character, a confirmation modal interrupts asking if they are sure.
- Deleting a character also requires confirmation.
- If the user insists on canceling actions, the interface reacts increasingly "angry," with vibrations, color changes, and rhetorical passive-aggressive messages.
- After multiple cancellations, the system questions the user's decisions with sarcastic prompts.

The goal of this BAD UI is to humorously and exaggeratedly demonstrate the importance of good usability principles: minimizing user interruptions, reducing friction, and designing intuitive, smooth interactions.

This project was also lightly inspired by the meme of **"microtransactions"** in modern games — where every small action is interrupted by unnecessary steps, creating frustration for the user.

## Final Words

Because why make it easy...
